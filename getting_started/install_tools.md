## Required tools

!> Before attending Vue study groups, please make sure to install the needed tools. You will not be able to participate in the activities without these.

### Text editors

Ruby does not require an IDE. You can opt to use one of these as your text editor (or your own choice).

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (all platforms)

!> Warning: Sublime Text shows a popup every hour prompting you to pay if you are using the free version. Please use another editor if you find this annoying.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (all platforms)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (all platforms)
- [Textmate](https://macromates.com/) (OS X only)

For more advanced users, you can opt to use these terminal-based editors:

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
